 <h2>Mushroom Soup</h2>
 <img src="../images/mushroom-soup.jpg" alt="mushroom soup" width="500" height="400">
 <p>Mushroom soup is a simple type of soup where a basic roux is thinned with cream or milk and then mushrooms and/or mushroom broth are added. It is well known in North America as a common type of condensed canned soup. Cream of mushroom soup is often used as a base ingredient in casseroles and comfort foods. This use is similar to that of a mushroom flavored gravy.</p>
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
   <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
   <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
   <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
   <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
   <li>1 cup milk</li>
   <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
   <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
   <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
   <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Directions</h2>
 <ol>
   <li>Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the onion in the butter for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and saute for 5 more
     minutes. Stir in the chicken broth and milk, and reduce heat to low. In a separate small bowl, mix the flour, salt, pepper, and thyme with a fork. Pour this into the soup and stir well, making sure the flour doesn't clump. Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
   <li>Finally, stir in the sour cream. Mix together and allow to heat through over low heat, about 3 to 5 minutes. Do not boil. Serve immediately.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Enjoy your delicious mushroom soup!</p>
